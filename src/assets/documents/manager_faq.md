- What is the Productivity Tool?
	- The Crossover Productivity Tool is a software package that logs the number of hours contractors work, provides extensive productivity insights, and monitors computer use to promote transparency. The tool is a computer-based agent that transfers all recorded information to Crossover.com. By logging on to Crossover.com, you can view each of your contractors’ Log Books (which gather and display the weekly hours worked) as well as a number of Dashboards that displays a plethora of information regarding work habits and productivity through various charts and graphs.

- Who Controls the Productivity Tool?
	- The contractor controls the Productivity Tool. With one simple click, he or she can turn the tool off and on. The tool only monitors computer usage when it is on.

- How Does the Productivity Tool Work?
	- When the Productivity Tool is on, it will capture six Virtual Timecards per hour. A Virtual Timecard is the combination of one screenshot and one webcam shot taken at random intervals every 10 minutes. The data is uploaded to the Crossover.com site, where all the Virtual Timecards from the week are recorded in the Log Book. You, your contractor, and the Crossover Productivity Team have access to this information at any time. The total hours recorded each week will be submitted for payment the following week, once reviewed by the Crossover Productivity Team.

- What is the Productivity Team Looking For?
	- The Productivity Team wants to help you and your contractor communicate transparently about the work contractors are doing. They will review the activity information generated from the Productivity Tool to ensure that contractors are spending their time on the tasks for which your company is being billed. For a detailed list of dispute categories and rules, please consult our [Guidelines for Success](/#/resources/guidelines).

- Legal Foundations
	- The Crossover Productivity Tool is legal and currently used by 1,000+ contractors in 54 countries throughout the globe. Over 13.5 million contractors around the world use similar software through numerous international freelancing platforms.

- How Does the Productivity Tool Benefit Me?
	- The tool enables managers to accurately assess the performance of their globally distributed team by providing data and key insights. Through the tool, managers are able to clearly define 30/60/90 day goals for their team and communicate regarding how their contractors are progressing. Ultimately, a manager using the tool knows when their team is working, is confident that billed hours are legitimate, and is aware of how he or she can help each team member become more productive.
		- ![Team Dashboard](https://s3.amazonaws.com/crossover-uploads-production/documents/team.png "Team Dashboard") Through your Team Dashboard, you can view data and stats on your team, including the number of hours worked, the progress towards goals, and each contractor’s individual productivity score. This dashboard also indicates security alerts that need to be reviewed.
		- ![Activity Dashboard](https://s3.amazonaws.com/crossover-uploads-production/documents/activity.png "Activity Dashboard") By clicking on one specific contractor, you can view his or her Activity Dashboard, which provides you with incredibly intricate information concerning that contractor’s work hours, productivity, and computer usage.

- How Does the Productivity Tool Benefit My Contractors?
	- The Productivity Tool seamlessly tracks all the hours your contractors work, while still giving them the flexibility to choose when they work. It helps ensure that they are compensated for all of the time they work, and are paid in a timely manner. Furthermore, by accessing their Activity Dashboard, contractors can view their personal productivity statistics to better understand the intricacies of how they work. The bottom of the dashboard clearly and transparently displays contractors’ progress on 30/60/90 day goals.

- Why the Productivity Tool?
	- We live in a flat world with talent in every corner of the globe. Companies are building highly talented and geographically distributed teams that require new software for collaboration and monitoring. The Crossover Productivity tool enables managers and contractors to increase their productivity, ensures the identity of remote workers, and validates hours worked.  It is essential in building trust and confidence among collaborators, regardless of location. The tool has also been proven to be effective through both anecdotal evidence and numerous trials. For example, one of our teams that was previously managed without the Productivity Tool was recently equipped with it. After just two weeks, the team experienced a 57% increase in productivity. After one month, the team has averaged a 32% increase in productivity.

- What is the Timeline for Billing and Payment?
	- The Crossover work week starts at 00:00 UTC-0 on Mondays and concludes at 23:59 UTC-0 on Sundays. The weekly timeline for billing and payment will occur as follows:

		###### Week 1: Contractors track their time using the Productivity Tool between Monday and Sunday.
		###### Week 2: Logged time bills to your company on Monday and is simultaneously reviewed by the Crossover Productivity Team throughout the week. They will be raising any issues directly to with the contractor for review.
		###### Week 3: Contractors’ net payments will become available on Wednesday of this week.

- What Else Do I Need to Know?
	- If contractors need to travel or conduct work while away from your computer, they can simply log Manual Time through the Log Book. Also, we understand that applications may crash, so Manual Time can be used to ensure that contractors get paid for all their work (Log Books will always be reviewed by the Crossover Productivity Team to ensure all billed time is work related). Furthermore, contractors are provided with 30 minutes of grace time every week. This means that if they are performing non-work related activities for less than 30 minutes within a week, that time will not be disputed.
