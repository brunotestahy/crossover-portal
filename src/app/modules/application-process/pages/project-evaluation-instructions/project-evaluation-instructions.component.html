  <h2 class="mt-4">Instructions</h2>
  <p class="pt-4">
    Try to complete the project as much as possible within given time-frame, even if you do not finish the
    assignment, your work will be evaluated depending on what and how much you completed. In case something comes
    up and you need more time, you can request an extension after you start the project.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that you are expected to work on the assignment independently. Discussing assignment details with
    colleagues or any indication of outside help will be considered cheating.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do not expect too much hand-holding as this is an evaluation assignment. You must make assumptions regarding
    any missing information, and describe these assumptions in your readme file.
  </p>
  <p>
    Read the complete assignment before you start. Understand clearly what is required so that your work will be
    appropriate and easier.
  </p>
  <p>
    The assignment will be similar to
    <a class="au-blue" href="https://techtrial.s3.amazonaws.com/System/Sample%20Software%20Engineer%20-%20Java%20Assignment%201.pdf"
      target="_blank">this</a>. Feel free to take a look at this sample project and have an idea about how our test looks like.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you click the "Start Project" button below, you will be given detailed instructions about the project.
    Once you begin, you will have <b>{{ data?.assignmentDaysCount }} days</b> to upload your submission.
    The project will most likely take at least 10 hours to complete, so please make sure that you have that time
    available before beginning.

      You can set them up now instead of using your precious project time.

  <h2 class="mt-4">Possible outcomes of the evaluation</h2>
  <p>
    We evaluate your delivery against the following three criteria: completeness, design quality and code quality.
  </p>
  <h5 class="au-blue mt-2">INVITED BUT NOT STARTED</h5>
  <p>
    If you are invited but do not start your assignment within the given invitation period, donâ€™t worry - you can
    apply again whenever you have the time.
  </p>
  <h5 class="au-blue mt-2">INVITED, STARTED, AND NOT DELIVERED</h5>
  <p>
    If you start your assignment but do not deliver it, you will be able to apply again for this same position
    after three months.
  </p>
  <h5 class="au-blue mt-2">INVITED, STARTED, DELIVERED AND SELECTED</h5>
  <p>
    If your assignment solution meets the criteria, we will invite you to a discussion with one of our
    Technical Evaluators. He will want to hear more about your project and your experience.
  </p>
  <h5 class="au-blue mt-2">INVITED, STARTED, DELIVERED AND NOT SELECTED</h5>
  <p>
    If you started and delivered your assignment solution but are not selected to move on, you may have a second
    chance! We will assess your score as well as the effort that you put into the assignment. If you qualify for a
    second chance, we will let you know by email and re-invite you to the project evaluation.
